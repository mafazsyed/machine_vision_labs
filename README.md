# Machine Vision Labs
Contains code for various machine vision labs.

## Tasks
### Task 1: Introduction to Machine Vision
- Part I: Analyze RGB image histograms from provided or personal images; discuss histogram differences and color component insights.
- Part II: Explore edge detection algorithms (Sobel, Prewitt) with varying parameters; focus on static object segmentation and discuss algorithm effectiveness.

### Task 2: Optical Flow Estimation Algorithm
- Part I: Apply optical flow estimation to identify corner points and track movements, using the 'Gingerbread Man' and 'Red Square' images.
- Part II: Calculate and analyze the root mean square error of the trajectory estimates; compare and discuss the accuracy of the optical flow algorithm.

### Task 3: Automatic Detection of Moving Objects in Video Frames
- Part I: Implement the frame differencing approach for vehicular traffic surveillance; analyze performance variations with different detection thresholds.
- Part II: Utilize the Gaussian mixture model approach; adjust parameters like Gaussian components and thresholds to optimize object detection.

### Task 4: Robot Treasure Hunting
- Implement an algorithm to enable a robot to find "treasures" in imagery data. Includes tasks of varying difficulty (easy, medium, hard) and requires creative solutions for image processing and pathfinding.

### Task 5: Image Classification with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Provide classification results using a CNN; discuss accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.
- Discuss improvements made to the CNN's performance and delve into ethical considerations related to image classification, focusing on equality, diversity, and inclusion.
